Todo:

Web:
  ☐ tool_create_notarget_los_v2.md - missing screenshot and links to tools
  ☐ create pages for tools to calculate distances and sizes
  ☐ document STEP_ANGLE field in tool_points_around result and tool_create_notarget_los_v2 (add also to tool_create_notarget_los???)
  ☐ does TARGET ID field makes sense for tool_create_notarget_los_v2?
