    "ALG_DESC": "This tool calculates the sizes of objects at specific distances (as specified in the table) that have a given horizontal angular size.<br/><br/> For example, it determines the sizes of objects that have a given horizontal angular size at the distances specified in the table.<br/><br/>To be usable in other plugin tools, two necessary parameters must be set: the default sampling size, used before the first distance from the table is applied, and the maximal distance. Both add a special row into the output table so that it can be correctly processed later.",
    "ALG_CREATOR": "Jan Caha", 
    "Angle": "Horizontal angular size that the objects should have (in degrees).",
    "Distance": "Distances of the objects in meters (table).",
    "DefaultSamplingDistance": "Sampling distance to be used in tools that work with this table for values smaller than the smallest distance.",
    "MaximalDistance": "Adds a special row to the output used in other tools. The row has the size of the object equal to the maximum size in the input table and a distance of -1. This is used to indicate the maximal possible length of the line of sight (LoS).",
    "OutputTable": "Output table containing information about the angle size, size of objects, and relevant distances."
